## What is GraphQL?

---

## Stability

- GraphQL is solid and stable and officially supported now

---

## Declarative

---

## Self-contained

- Data pieces live where they are used
- Like when we moved from `html/`, `css/`, `javascript/` to `components/`

---

## Trade-offs

---

# Syntax

---

# Tools

---

## GraphiQL

---

## Browser Dev Tools

---

# Examples

---

## cURL

---

## Fetch

---

## Libraries

- https://graphql.org/code

---

## Apollo

- Apollo works with React, Angular, Vue, vanilla JS etc.

---

## Adding Apollo to a new React app

---

{apollo next.js example + apollo getting started pieces}

---

## Adding Apollo to an existing React + Redux app

---

{redux => apollo pieces}

---

## Trade-offs of GraphQL + Apollo

### Pros

- Similiar trade-offs to going from vanilla JS to React but for data
- Opens up lots of community tools: Apollo addons, Prisma, etc.

### Cons

- Locked in to GraphQL
- Still a little new
- Most systems still in REST

# Review

## Declarative

What data your component needs, not how to get it/store it/update it etc.

## Self-contained

Data requirements live where they are used

## Community

Can rely on libraries for common functionality
